# react-tfl
Small coding task for React developers.

You will need to develop a web application that integrates with TfL's API https://api.tfl.gov.uk/ that shows live line status updates that is very similar to https://tfl.gov.uk/tube-dlr-overground/status/

Rules:

- You may need to sign up to use TfL's API in order to get the line statuses
- Demonstrate your use of React (create react app/Next.js is fine to use) and Redux, how you would call the API and store the results in the Redux store ready for frontend usage
- There's no need to use a CSS framework for this task and you may use the same colour/layout as seen in the TFL website
- Follow coding best practices
- We must be able to build and run your code without any errors
- Please submit your code to GitHub or GitLab
- You can use READMEs to explain a folder's purpose/structure/approach you have taken to solve this

It should take a couple of hours. Happy coding and please avoid shaving the yak bald :)
